### Section 1: Motivation and Purpose

Wealth inequality is a common topic in the news. A related but less discussed topic is health inequality. It has been called the “lottery of life”. Depending on your roll of the dice, you may have been born into a developed country where you can expect to live to the ripe age of 89, or born into a developing country where you are lucky to live past 40.

To address this inequality we wish to better understand global trends in life expectancy. Our goal is to help decision-makers (e.g. governments, charities, NGO’s) decide where and what to invest in to improve the life expectancy for all. Our app will visualize several factors across 193 countries to better understand the global macro trends.

### Section 2: Description of the data

The data was retrieved from Kaggle. The original sources of data are World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations. There are 22 variables and 2938 observations. We will be visualizing life expectancy (`Life expectancy`) with other 6 possible predictor variables. The six predictor variables are: years ranging from 2000 to 2015 (`Year`), 193 countries (`Country`), the development status of country (`Status`), Gross Domestic Product per capita in USD (`GDP`), expenditure on health as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product per capita (`percentage expenditure`) and general government expenditure on health as a percentage of total government expenditure (`Total expenditure`). For the detailed description of the data, please see [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who)

### Section 3: Research questions and usage scenarios

Our dashboard application is focused on, but not restricted to, answering the following research questions:

1. How has the life expectancy by country changed over time? 
2. How are monetary factors associated with life expectancy? 
3. Does the life expectancy between developing and developed countries differ? 

The application can be used in a scenario like this: 

> Rachel is a public health researcher and she needs to compare the annual trends of the life expectancy between countries and identify the relationship that it has with monetary variables. Using the “World Life Expectancy Dashboard app”, she can compare life expectancy between countries that she chose from the drop-down menu and observe how it changes over time. From the heatmap of the life expectancy of countries, Rachel can observe a certain pattern of low life expectancy forming around a specific region. She can conduct follow up research to identify the financial, social or environmental factor that is causing the problem of inequality.
