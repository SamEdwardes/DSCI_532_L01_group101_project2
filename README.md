## App Description and Sketch

The app contains one page that includes four main plots and four summary statistics. The left column of plots visualize `life expectancy`, `change in life expectancy`, `GDP` (gross domestic product), and `percentage of GDP spent on health` over time. The right column of plots includes a geographic heat map that can compare `life expectancy`, `GDP`, or `percentage of GDP spent on health` and a histogram of the distribution of life expectancy.

One of the most interesting features of this dashboard is the ability to change the variable each plot explores. By allowing the user to choose the variable of the y-axis and colour for time series plots, and the colour variable for the heat map, users are able to answer many potential questions with a limited number of plots and screen real estate.

The dashboard will also include interactive elements. Tooltips will be used on all data points to allow the user to see precise values. The summary numbers at the top of the dashboard will serve as a “grounding point” so the user can easily compare individual observations to in view averages. Users are also able to filter the entire dashboard based on `country status` (developing or not developing), `country`, and a range of `years`.
